API Gateway with JWT Authentication


Overview:

This project implements an API Gateway using Spring Cloud Gateway that facilitates secure communication between clients and microservices. The gateway accepts JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, validates these tokens, and routes requests to the appropriate backend services based on user requests.


Features:

- Token Validation: The gateway checks the validity of JWT tokens provided in the Authorization header of incoming requests, ensuring secure access to protected resources.
- Dynamic Routing: Routes requests to specific microservices based on predefined paths, allowing seamless integration of multiple services in a microservices architecture.
- Error Handling: Implements robust error handling for unauthorized access, ensuring that clients receive appropriate responses when token validation fails.
